# 3. Asset Lineage

## 3.1 Inserting lineage
To have a lineage, we need at least two assets to be linked with each other.
Compass only needs one of the assets to define the lineage.

Let's create a new dashboard asset (tableau) that uses data from the `main-postgres:my-database.orders` table asset that we created earlier in [first section](./1-my-first-asset.md#13-sending-your-first-asset-to-compass).
And while creating the asset, we can also define its lineage in the same request.

<Tabs groupId="api">
  <TabItem value="cli" label="CLI" default>

```bash
$ compass asset edit --body=<path to the asset.json file>
```
Example asset.json configuration for creating the `upstream` lineage (denoting the source of the asset data)
```json
{
    "asset": {
        "urn": "main-postgres:my-database.orders",
        "type": "table",
        "service": "postgres",
        "name": "orders",
        "data": {
            "database": "my-database3",
            "namespace": "main-postgres"
        }
    },
    "upstreams": [
        {
            "urn": "main-postgres:my-database.orders"
        }
    ]
}
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="http" label="HTTP">

```bash
curl --location --request PATCH 'http://localhost:8080/v1beta1/assets' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'Compass-User-UUID: john.doe@example.com' \
--data-raw '{
    "asset": {
        "urn": "tableau:my-dashboard.daily-orders",
        "type": "dashboard",
        "service": "tableau",
        "name": "Daily Orders Dashboard",
        "description": "This is a dashboard showing daily orders"
    },
    "upstreams": [
        {
            "urn": "main-postgres:my-database.orders"
        }
    ]
}'
```

 </TabItem>
</Tabs>

We use `upstreams` and `downstreams` field to define lineage.
From the example above `main-postgres:my-database.orders` is the source of the dashboard, so we put it inside `upstreams` field.

And just like that we created a lineage :)

## Querying Lineage

Once lineage is defined, we can easily fetch them using a single asset URN to be the center of the lineage like below

<Tabs groupId="api">
  <TabItem value="cli" label="CLI" default>

```bash
$ compass lineage tableau:my-dashboard.daily-orders
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="http" label="HTTP">

```bash
curl 'http://localhost:8080/v1beta1/lineage/tableau:my-dashboard.daily-orders' \
--header 'Compass-User-UUID: john.doe@example.com'
```

 </TabItem>
</Tabs>

And you will get this as the response

```json
{
    "data": [
        {
            "source": "main-postgres:my-database.orders",
            "target": "tableau:my-dashboard.daily-orders",
            "prop": {
                "root": "tableau:my-dashboard.daily-orders"
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

You can also get the lineage using the URN `main-postgres:my-database.orders`, even when you have only defined `upstreams` on `tableau:my-dashboard.daily-orders`.

<Tabs groupId="api">
  <TabItem value="cli" label="CLI" default>

```bash
$ compass lineage main-postgres:my-database.orders
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="http" label="HTTP">

```bash
curl 'http://localhost:8080/v1beta1/lineage/main-postgres:my-database.orders' \
--header 'Compass-User-UUID: john.doe@example.com'
```

 </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Conclusion

This is merely a simple example of how Compass can help you manage and build your Data Lineage.
You just need to dump all of your assets along with its `upstreams` and `downstreams` as shown above and Compass will take care of the rest.

And that's it, we have just covered all the basics of Compass and how you can use it to manage and maintain your metadata.
Aside from features introduced in this tour, Compass also has additional features such as Asset starring and discussion, you can check those in the [Guides section](../guides/starring).
