# Roadmap

In the following section you can learn about what features we're working on, what stage they're in, and when we expect to bring them to you. Have any questions or comments about items on the roadmap? Join the [discussions](https://github.com/goto/compass/core/discussions) on Compass Github forum.

If you would like to suggest new items or request timeline changes to the existing items, please submit a GitHub feature request.

We’re planning to iterate on the format of the roadmap itself, and we see potential to engage more in discussions about the future of Compass features. If you have feedback about this roadmap section itself, such as how the issues are presented, let us know through [discussions](https://github.com/goto/compass/core/discussions).
